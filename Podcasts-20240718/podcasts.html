<p>News-focused with little commentary, but opinions still sneak in.
Compact and has a great signal-to-noise ratio.</p>
<p>If you want to listen to only one Linux podcast, this is my
recommendation.</p>
<h4><a href="https://linuxunplugged.com/">Linux Unplugged</a> [Weekly, 1h-1.5h] (Jupiter Broadcasting)</h4>
<p>A more chaotic Linux news show, meandering with lots of breadth and
depth.</p>
<h4><a href="https://selfhosted.show/">Self-Hosted</a> [Bi-weekly, 45m-60m] (Jupiter Broadcasting)</h4>
<p>DIY show covering home hosting and home automation in hopes of
steering clear of cloud and Googly services.</p>
<h4><a href="https://coder.show/">Coder Radio</a> [Weekly, 45m-60m] (Jupiter Broadcasting)</h4>
<p>I like its self-description, “A weekly talk show taking a pragmatic
look at the art and business of Software Development and the world
of technology.”</p>
<p>If you’re interested in peeking into the world of software
development and running a dev shop, this is an entertaining show.</p>
<h4><a href="https://latenightlinux.com/">Late Night Linux</a> [Bi-weekly, 25m-35m] (Late Night Linux)</h4>
<p>Provides news and analyses on what’s happening in the Linux and
open-source communities.</p>
<h4><a href="https://linuxafterdark.net/">Linux After Dark</a> [Bi-weekly, 20m-25m] (Late Night Linux)</h4>
<p>A more relaxed version of “Late Night Linux” with broader topics and
from a more personal experiences angle.</p>
<h4><a href="https://2.5admins.com/">2.5 Admins</a> [Weekly, 30m] (Late Night Linux)</h4>
<p>The show focuses on system administration, IT infrastructure, and
cybersecurity of Linux systems.  This show’s discussions can get
pretty technical.</p>
<h4><a href="https://www.linuxdevtime.com/">Linux Dev Time</a> [Bi-weekly, 20m-30m] (Late Night Linux)</h4>
<p>Where “Coder Radio” is more focused on the business side of software
development, “Linux Dev Time” is more on the job and challenges of
being a developer on Linux and open-source.</p>
