#### [This Week in Linux](https://tuxdigital.com/podcasts/this-week-in-linux/) [Weekly, 25m] (TuxDigital)

News-focused with little commentary, but opinions still sneak in.
Compact and has a great signal-to-noise ratio.

If you want to listen to only one Linux podcast, this is my
recommendation.

#### [Linux Unplugged](https://linuxunplugged.com/) [Weekly, 1h-1.5h] (Jupiter Broadcasting)

A more chaotic Linux news show, meandering with lots of breadth and
depth.

#### [Self-Hosted](https://selfhosted.show/) [Bi-weekly, 45m-60m] (Jupiter Broadcasting)

DIY show covering home hosting and home automation in hopes of
steering clear of cloud and Googly services.

#### [Coder Radio](https://coder.show/) [Weekly, 45m-60m] (Jupiter Broadcasting)

I like its self-description, "A weekly talk show taking a pragmatic
look at the art and business of Software Development and the world
of technology."

If you're interested in peeking into the world of software
development and running a dev shop, this is an entertaining show.

#### [Late Night Linux](https://latenightlinux.com/) [Bi-weekly, 25m-35m] (Late Night Linux)

Provides news and analyses on what's happening in the Linux and
open-source communities.

#### [Linux After Dark](https://linuxafterdark.net/) [Bi-weekly, 20m-25m] (Late Night Linux)

A more relaxed version of "Late Night Linux" with broader topics and
from a more personal experiences angle.

#### [2.5 Admins](https://2.5admins.com/) [Weekly, 30m] (Late Night Linux)

The show focuses on system administration, IT infrastructure, and
cybersecurity of Linux systems.  This show's discussions can get
pretty technical.

#### [Linux Dev Time](https://www.linuxdevtime.com/) [Bi-weekly, 20m-30m] (Late Night Linux)

Where "Coder Radio" is more focused on the business side of software
development, "Linux Dev Time" is more on the job and challenges of
being a developer on Linux and open-source.
