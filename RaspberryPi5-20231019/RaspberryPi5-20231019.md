### Intro

The Raspberry Pi 5 comes in 2 memory sizes, 4GB and 8GB for $60 and
$80.  That makes it slightly more expensive than the Pi 4 which is
$55 and $75 for the same memory sizes.

If you were fast enough on ordering, you might get one as early as
a couple of weeks.  But that run is sold out now.  The second run
should be in January or February, but I think that's now sold out
too.

### The Great

The Raspberry Pi 5 performance is quite a leap over the Raspberry Pi
4.  Much faster CPU and memory.  Those enhancements let the Pi5 run
about two to three times as fast as the Pi4.

GPU performance also has a nice bump and now it can drive two
4K displays at 60 Hz simultaneously.

### The Good

MicroSD card slot can run faster with the right card.

The USB 3.0 ports can each run at their full speed (5Gb/s).

Now for the first time, it comes with a Real Time Clock!  No need
to connect to a network just to get the time of day.

Now has a power button like my Orange Pi 5!

### The Unchanged

Bluetooth and WiFi are unchanged, but can have increased performance
with the faster CPU and memory.

### The Detriments

Heat.  And did I mention it runs hot?

Without the board downclocking itself from burning up, it now requires
active cooling (heat sink with fan).  The fan though will spin up or
down depending on the board's temperature.

If the Pi 5 is only given passive cooling, it'll run about the same
speed as a Pi 4.

The fan doesn't generate a lot of noise, even at max RPM, but it is
an extra expense adding to total cost (about $5).

Doesn't come with a M.2 SSD slot.  You can add one with a HAT, but
that's an extra expense.  If you remember from January, my Orange Pi 5
came with a native M.2 slot included.

New USB-C power supply that requires 5A now.  Pi 4 supply was just 3A.

No audio jack.

### Who's it for?

If you have a need for a faster performing Raspberry Pi that's
generally compatible with Raspberry Pi HATs, this is a board
for you.

Otherwise, it gets expensive adding up all the costs to make it a
low-end desktop PC or a media server or other roles.  These days
there's plenty of alternatives at cheaper prices and/or better
performance.
