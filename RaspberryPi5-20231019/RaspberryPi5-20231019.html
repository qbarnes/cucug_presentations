<p>The Raspberry Pi 5 comes in 2 memory sizes, 4GB and 8GB for $60 and
$80.  That makes it slightly more expensive than the Pi 4 which is
$55 and $75 for the same memory sizes.</p>
<p>If you were fast enough on ordering, you might get one as early as
a couple of weeks.  But that run is sold out now.  The second run
should be in January or February, but I think that’s now sold out
too.</p>
<h3>The Great</h3>
<p>The Raspberry Pi 5 performance is quite a leap over the Raspberry Pi
4.  Much faster CPU and memory.  Those enhancements let the Pi5 run
about two to three times as fast as the Pi4.</p>
<p>GPU performance also has a nice bump and now it can drive two
4K displays at 60 Hz simultaneously.</p>
<h3>The Good</h3>
<p>MicroSD card slot can run faster with the right card.</p>
<p>The USB 3.0 ports can each run at their full speed (5Gb/s).</p>
<p>Now for the first time, it comes with a Real Time Clock!  No need
to connect to a network just to get the time of day.</p>
<p>Now has a power button like my Orange Pi 5!</p>
<h3>The Unchanged</h3>
<p>Bluetooth and WiFi are unchanged, but can have increased performance
with the faster CPU and memory.</p>
<h3>The Detriments</h3>
<p>Heat.  And did I mention it runs hot?</p>
<p>Without the board downclocking itself from burning up, it now requires
active cooling (heat sink with fan).  The fan though will spin up or
down depending on the board’s temperature.</p>
<p>If the Pi 5 is only given passive cooling, it’ll run about the same
speed as a Pi 4.</p>
<p>The fan doesn’t generate a lot of noise, even at max RPM, but it is
an extra expense adding to total cost (about $5).</p>
<p>Doesn’t come with a M.2 SSD slot.  You can add one with a HAT, but
that’s an extra expense.  If you remember from January, my Orange Pi 5
came with a native M.2 slot included.</p>
<p>New USB-C power supply that requires 5A now.  Pi 4 supply was just 3A.</p>
<p>No audio jack.</p>
<h3>Who’s it for?</h3>
<p>If you have a need for a faster performing Raspberry Pi that’s
generally compatible with Raspberry Pi HATs, this is a board
for you.</p>
<p>Otherwise, it gets expensive adding up all the costs to make it a
low-end desktop PC or a media server or other roles.  These days
there’s plenty of alternatives at cheaper prices and/or better
performance.</p>
