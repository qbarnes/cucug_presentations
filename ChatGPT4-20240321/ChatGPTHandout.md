## A Method for Good Prompts (CREATE)

### C: Character / Context

Define the role you want ChatGPT to respond from.

"Act as a Linux software engineer with 20 years experience."

"You are a graphics designer with 15 years experience living in
San Francisco, California."

"You are a 73 year old grandpa."


### R: Request

This is the task you want ChatGPT to do.  Be as specific and clear
as possible.  The clearer and more precise the task, the better the
chances of a great response.

"I want you to write a Bash shell script invoking any commonly
installed command line tools that will scan all the hosts on a local
subnet for open ports and report those open ports in a human-readable
format grouped by host."

"Draw a new logo for a company called Eggs'R'Us based in Canada that
makes spatulas and frying pans and whose corporate colors are dark
yellow and light blue."

"Write a bedtime story for a four year old child who loves fishing,
barbies, polar bears, and bacon.  Include some entertaining sound
effects."


### E: Examples

This is optional, but you may want to provide examples of a style
or styles you may want ChatGPT to follow.

"Use the Linux kernel coding style."

"Write in the style of Edgar Allan Poe."


### A: Adjustments

These are changes to the output that was generated.

"Add additional code comments to make the shell script easier to
understand by someone with little shell scripting knowledge and
add more robust error checking."

"Make the logo appear in a more 1950s diner style."


### T: Type of Output

For programming, this can be languages such as C, 6502 assembly,
Fortran, Java, Bash shell, etc.

Tell ChatGPT how to format your output.  For human consumption, it
can be paragraphs, bullet points, iambic pentameter, pig latin, with
or without jargon, etc.

"With an college reading level, provide a 100 word paragraph and 4
bullet points describing reasons for visiting Seattle, Washington
for summer vacation."


### E: Extras

"Ask questions before answering."

"Ignore everything before this prompt."

"Explain your thinking."

"Cite your sources."

"Act unlike a typical AI."
