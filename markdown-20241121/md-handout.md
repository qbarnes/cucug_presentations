Markdown is a lightweight markup language that allows you to create
formatted text using a plain-text editor.

It's used for writing documentation, notes, and even creating web
content without the complexity of traditional word processors or
HTML coding.

### Benefits

  * Intuitive: simple, easy to pick up
  * Portable: just uses plain-text files
  * Versatile: converts to various formats (HTML, PDF, Word, etc.)
  * Widely used: documentation, README's, notes
